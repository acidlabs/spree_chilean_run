Spree Chilean Run
===============

This Spree extension adds address integration with chilean RUN.

Installation
------------

Add spree_chilean_run to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_chilean_run', branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_chilean_run:install
```

Dependencies
-------
- [run_cl](https://bitbucket.org/mespina/run)


Usage
-------
A `run` string field is added to the `Spree::Address` model. It's integrated with [run_cl](https://bitbucket.org/mespina/run) gem, so validations are performed automatically when persisting an address object. Validations are:

- Presence
- RUN format

The field is added to markup inside:

- `address` checkout step
- Backend user address
- Backend order address

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories. The `run` field is added to the Spree default `address` factory.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_chilean_run/factories'
```
